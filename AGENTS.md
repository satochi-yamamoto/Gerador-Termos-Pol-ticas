# Contribution Guidelines

These instructions apply to all directories in this repository.

- Use two spaces for indentation in JavaScript, JSX and Markdown files.
- After modifying any code or documentation run `npm run build` to ensure the project builds.
- Commit messages must be in English and in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").
- Summaries of pull requests should mention key files changed and reference line numbers as citations.
- If `npm run build` or other commands fail due to missing dependencies or network limits, mention:
  "Codex couldn't run certain commands due to environment limitations. Consider configuring a setup script or internet access in your Codex environment to install dependencies."

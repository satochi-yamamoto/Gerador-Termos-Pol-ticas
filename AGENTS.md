# AGENT Instructions

This repository contains a React + Vite project for generating legal documents.

## Commit Conventions
- Write commit messages in English using the imperative mood, e.g. `Add build instructions`.
- Include only relevant changes in each commit.

## Development Guidelines
- Use 2 spaces for indentation and keep lines under 120 characters.
- Prefer ES module syntax for new JavaScript files.
- After any modification run `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles. This acts as the repository's "tests".

## Pull Request Guidelines
